  <h1>Aggressively Midwestern</h1>
  <p>This is my Radio Show that I run with my friend on the schools radio station WIIT 88.9 FM.</p>
  <p>We value the openness of expression through music which is why we run in a timeslot that does not require the censoring of our music.</p>
  
  <h2>A Description Of Our Show</h2>
  <p>Hailing from the rust-ridden backyards of the American midwest, two Cryptid Co-Hosts are taking you on an angsty road trip.</p> 
  <p>From seedy basement shows with bands whose names are too long to remember, to drowning yourself in a bottle of ranch after your latest breakup. Scream along as DJ's Dogman and Kitchen Goblin soundtrack your misery with both the big names and the unknowns of Midwest emo.</p> 
  <p>Or whatever else fits the vibe of whiny vocals belted into a walmart mic, and buzzing guitars emanating from your parents garage. Join us Thursdays at 10:00 to 11:30 PM and forget about "Midwest-Polite" cause we are "Aggressively Midwestern".</p>
