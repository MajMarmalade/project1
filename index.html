  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Trent Kauflin, I am a first year Cybersecurity Major who could have gone to art school. Instead of doing that however, I chose to go to IIT in hopes of making that "<i>cybersecurity salary bank</i>."</p> 
  <p>In order to fund my true dream of becoming a tattoo artist... at least thats what I think it is right now.</p>
  
  <h3>My Hobbies </h3>
  <h4>Guitar:</h4> 
  <p>Dispite not being very good I own 5 guitars, and 4 amps. My favorite guitar is a sea foam green Danelectro Baritone. Most of my time playing guitar is spent messing around and trying to make fun metal riffs on this guitar.</p>
  <h4>Art:</h4>
  <p>I love illustrating, drawing diffrent characters, and using them to tell stories. In my high school years I designed my own Tarot Deck, and started a variety of unfinished comics. </p>
  <h4>Game Design:</h4>
  <p>I have worked on and done art for multiple games. One of which being a 3D cart racing game called "<a href="https://chasevelloney.itch.io/sirkartman" target="_blank">Sir Kart Man</a>" that I worked on with my friend Chase.</p>
